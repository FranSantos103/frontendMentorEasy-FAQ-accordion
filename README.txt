Work Sans Variable Font
=======================

This download contains Work Sans as both variable fonts and static fonts.

Work Sans is a variable font with this axis:
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in these files:
  WorkSans-VariableFont_wght.ttf
  WorkSans-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that aren’t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
in those cases you can use the static font files for Work Sans:

  static/WorkSans-Light.ttf
  static/WorkSans-Regular.ttf
  static/WorkSans-Medium.ttf
